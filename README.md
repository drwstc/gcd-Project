The purpose of the submitted R script "run_analysis.R" was to satisfy the course project requirement as following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        can be found in table "ttdata"

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        can be found in table "ttsele"

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        can be found in table "tta_data"

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
        can be found in table "tta_data"

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
        can be found in table "ttas_sum"

The dataset includes the following files:
